	<p>This is a skeleton for web development projects with Codeigniter.
	This project is primarily PHP based, using both Bootstrap and JQuery.</p>

	<h2>Setup</h2>
	<ul>
		<li> The document root is in the public folder. In a production server, please set the server document root to this folder; the other application folders should not be publicly accessible.

		<li>Configuration options (e.g. database, base url, etc) is available in application > config</li>

		<li>Autoloaded helpers can be added in application > config > autoload.php</li>

		<li>Remember to fix the index.php directory paths from system --> ../system to account for the new folder structure</li> 
	</ul>
