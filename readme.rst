This project is primarily PHP based, using both Bootstrap and JQuery.

/** SETUP AND DIAGNOSIS **/

* The document root is in the public folder. In a production server, please set the server document root to this folder; the other application folders should not be publicly accessible.

* Configuration options (e.g. database, base url, etc) is available in application > config

* Autoloaded helpers can be added in application > config > autoload.php

* Remember to fix the index.php directory paths from system --> ../system to account for the new folder structure
